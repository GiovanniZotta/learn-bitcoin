# Invest in Bitcoin?

If you have read up to here you have already invested time and energy in learning about Bitcoin. Why should or should you not start to begin to use Bitcoin for yourself? Well, I advise you not to do so until you are sure that you want to try it. Only invest as much in Bitcoin as you understand and are comfortable to, only as much as you are willing to lose in the worst case scenario.

The more you get to know and use it, the more trust you will build. I researched the topic for three months before I installed my first bitcoin wallet and exchanged my first 75 euro to bitcoin. I want to help you to make up your mind and will discuss the most common for and against Bitcoin arguments.
