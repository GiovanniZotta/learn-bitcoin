## How are bitcoin created?

We were talking about protocols and mathematical rules that regulate how Bitcoin is working. A set of rules define how bitcoin are created and circulated. These rules can only be changed in a majority consensus of all parties involved in the Bitcoin network. Individuals, institutions or governments cannot change the Bitcoin rules unilaterally.

In our current monetary system and currencies, the creation of money is in the hands of central bankers (as we discussed on page **INSERT PAGE NUMBER HERE**). They are steering and controlling the output of banknotes and coins as well as the amount of credit that commercial banks may lend out, determining the interest rate and thus influencing the value of the units of money.

Bitcoin are created in a process called mining in a decentralized manner, out of the hands of people with power. The term "mining" has been chosen because, similar to the extraction of gold, labor and energy input is required for the creation of bitcoin.
