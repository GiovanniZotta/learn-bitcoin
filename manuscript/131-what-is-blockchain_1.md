# What is a blockchain?
The Bitcoin blockchain is a public, immutable database where all Bitcoin transactions are stored. Thus, "the blockchain" itself is not the revolutionary technological breakthrough as it is usually described in the media. As you have learned in the chapter "The History of Bitcoin", adding a blockchain was the final element that solved the problem of double-spending and enabled the decentralized issuance of money on a secured decentralized network. Bitcoin has a lot of other preceding technology in it.

In fact Satoshi Nakamoto never mentioned the word blockchain. Instead, Nakamoto used the term time chain, because the ledger's main use is to store all transactions in the correct timely order. 

Since the word blockchain has become the commonly used term, I will follow suit in using it. The Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked since it was created in 2009. Every single transaction has been stored on the blockchain since 2009. Every transfer that has been made in Bitcoin since its inception is decentrally stored on an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 computers worldwide. These computers are run by individuals, universities, exchanges and so on. This decentralization makes it hard to attack Bitcoin because if you attack one computer and the blockchain, then there are thousands of identical databases as a back-up. Attempting to introduce false transactions to the ledger will result in failure because the rest of the nodes around the world would fail to reach a consensus with the impostor node, rejecting its transaction record.

The Bitcoin blockchain data is transparent and public. If you make a transaction you can look it up in a Bitcoin explorer, which is like a search engine that crawls the database of transactions as opposed to web pages. You can see the value on a bitcoin address that is recorded on the blockchain. With your private keys, the blockchain equivalent of your password, you have access and can move the value on the blockchain to another address. 

The Bitcoin blockchain belongs to no one, anyone can download it and store it on their own computer. With this "full node" you also contribute to the strengthening of the Bitcoin network. Why? With more live copies of the blockchain, the network becomes less susceptible to attacks.

**Open and permissioned blockchains**

Please note the difference between Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are open blockchains and for instance "Diem" the money project by Facebook or the Chinese governments E-Yuan CBDC which are closed, centralized blockchains. 

An open blockchain is accessible to all people, it is decentralized, transparent, uncensorable and neutral. Making it the revolutionary money it is. A global, internet native system that is open for everyone regardless of age, color, privilege, gender or nation. Bitcoin can even be used by machines. And no one can keep you from sending it peer-to-peer around the world. 

A permissioned, private blockchain, is closed, non-transparent, hierarchically organized and centrally stored. The company or government running the system can exclude and censor your transactions. They can close your account and keep you from spending your money. You know this system, because that's how the current traditional banking system works.
