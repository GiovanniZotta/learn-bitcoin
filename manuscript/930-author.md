Anita Posch is a Bitcoin advocate, author, solopreneur and host of the Anita Posch show. She is a member of the board of Bitcoin Austria - an educational non-profit organization. 

Before she started her educational Bitcoin work in 2017, Anita gained over 20 years of experience in web development, e-commerce, and online business. Disillusioned by the centralized nature of the internet, consumerism and surveillance capitalism she spent 2016 in Berlin on a mission to make a change.

In early 2017 she attended a talk about Bitcoin and open blockchain technology and the positive impact it could have on society. She realized that a technology which is permissionless, inflation-proof and a global internet money could free billions of people, disenfranchised by current financial power dynamics. Bitcoin is unstoppable money that can be used by anyone regardless of who they are. It's neutral, not controlled by any company or government, while at the same time being an internet protocol, financial rails that is built for a common good.

Anita's goal is to bring Bitcoin to billions through her educational work. She has developed a Bitcoin podcast, a YouTube channel and wrote the book (L)earn Bitcoin, which will be translated into a variety of languages. She has also interviewed people from all around the world including some from developing countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Venezuela, and Afghanistan about the effects of Bitcoin on people's freedom.

In early 2020 she was the first Bitcoiner to visit Zimbabwe to research the country's monetary situation as well as the adoption rate of Bitcoin and to report on the results in her podcast. The goal was, through interviews, to build a bridge between people who live under flawed democracies or authoritarian regimes to the rest of the world and to show how Bitcoin could improve their living conditions and financial freedom.

Bitcoin is money from the people, for the people. It's mathematical rules can't be corrupted - neither by governments nor by billionaires. This guarantees a level of fairness which cannot be achieved in traditional human driven systems. It gives underprivileged individuals, such as people from developing nations, women, and oppressed minority groups, the chance to participate globally in a free and private manner with each other. This freedom to exchange value, unleashing people's creativity and innovation, is what drives Anita Posch. 

Anita translated two volumes of [The Internet of Money](https://anita.link/idg2) by Andreas M. Antonopoulos into German. Her research and activities around Bitcoin are discussed in media all over the world: Bitcoin Magazine, CoinDesk, What Bitcoin Did, Bayern2, Deutschlandfunk, Radio FM4, and ARD television, among others.
