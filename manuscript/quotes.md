> “Bitcoin is no one’s liability. There’s no one that guarantees the value of that Bitcoin. People say that’s a weakness. That’s actually a strength. That means there’s no situation where the backer of that Bitcoin could withdraw their backing. The backing of Bitcoin comes from the fact that the market, as this collective view, the Bitcoin is worth whatever it’s worth. I would put Bitcoin in the category of liability-free collateral. Which is similar to gold or another monetary commodity.” – **Nic Carter**
