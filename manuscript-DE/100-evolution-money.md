# Die Evolution des Geldes

Am 3. Januar 2009 wurde Bitcoin geboren. Seither hat das Bitcoin Peer-zu-Peer Protokoll etwa alle 10 Minuten einen neuen Datenblock mit Transaktionen an eine Kette von Datenblöcken angehängt. Regelmäßig wie unser Herzschlag. Die Bitcoin-Blockchain speichert alle Transaktionen in der korrekten, chronologischen Abfolge, die nachträglich nicht verändert werden kann. Unveränderbar wie der Zeitablauf von Geschehnissen. Dieser Prozess ist selbstregulierend. Dies ist durch ein System möglich, das auf Kryptographie, Spieltheorie, IT und dezentralen Netzwerken aufbaut.

Dieses System hat die folgenden Eigenschaften:

-   Bitcoin-Transaktionen sind zensurresistent.
-   Bitcoin ist unveränderbar.
-   Bitcoin kann nicht gefälscht werden.
-   Bitcoin-Transaktionen sind ohne Intermediäre, wie Banken, hochsicher.
-   Bitcoin-Transaktionen sind transparent, öffentlich einsehbar und können von allen geprüft werden.

![Eine PayPal Zahlung vs. Bitcoin](assets/_paypal-bitcoin-intermediaries.PNG) [^1]
Bei einer traditionellen Zahlung gibt es bis zu sieben Intermediäre bis die Zahlung das Ziel erreicht. Bei Bitcoin gibt es keine.

-   Bitcoin ist ein neutrales Netzwerk: es moralisiert und beurteilt nicht, ob eine Zahlung aus irgendeiner subjektiven Sicht "gut" oder "schlecht" ist.
-   Bitcoin ist erlaubnisfrei: es muss niemand um Erlaubnis gebeten werden, um es zu nutzen.
-   Bitcoin ist grenzenlos: es kann global verwendet werden.
-   Bitcoin, das Internet Protokoll, ist Allgemeingut: es gehört der Öffentlichkeit, jeder und jedem einzelnen von uns, nicht einer juristischen Einheit wie einem Unternehmen.
-   Die Regeln des Bitcoin-Netzwerks werden durch den programmatisch gesicherten Konsens aller Beteiligten bestimmt.

Bitcoin ist das Geld der Menschen. Bitcoin ist die Evolution des Geldes. Es ist Ergebnis der ständigen Weiterentwicklung des Geldes, die Teil der Menschheitsgeschichte ist. Über die Jahrtausende sind neue Formen des Geldes gefunden und genutzt worden. Von direktem Tausch zwischen Menschen über das Kreditsystem zum Goldstandard, bis zum heutigen ungedeckten, inflationären Fiat-Geldsystem. Das Banken- und Währungssystem wie wir es heute kennen, ist vor etwa 300 Jahren entstanden. Es ist logisch, dass sich nach der Verbreitung völlig neuer Kommunikationsformen durch das Internet, neue Ökonomien gebildet haben, denen letzendlich ein Internet-natives Geld entsprungen ist.

![Die Geschichte des Geldes](assets/_money-history.png) [^2]

Programmierbares kryptographisches Geld oder das "Internet des Geldes", wie es Andreas M. Antonopoulos bezeichnet, ist unaufhaltbar. Wir befinden uns am Beginn einer neuen Ära in der Geschichte der Menschheit.


## Rai, Steingeld von Yap

Falls Sie Bitcoin verwirrend und eine Blockchain als Kontobuch, das von Allen kontrolliert werden kann, unvorstellbar finden, könnte das Steingeld von Yap als Anschauungsbeispiel dienen. 

Das Steingeld sind große Steinscheiben, die auf der Insel Yap im westlichen Pazifik (Mikronesien) genutzt wurden. Sie wurden aus den Kalksteinvorkommen der Insel Palau abgebaut und bis ins 20. Jahrhundert als Währung verwendet.

![Rai Steine mit Tragehilfen, 1903](assets/_Stone_Money_of_Uap_1903_Jayne,_String_Figures_p160.jpg) [^3] 

Rai Steine wurden mit dem Boot von Palau nach Yap gebracht. Aufgrund ihrer Größe und Gewichts wurde ihre Lage nach der Ankunft nicht mehr verändert, sondern die Bezahlung erfolgte durch den Besitzerwechsel. Jede Transaktion wurde in der kleinen Gemeinschaft mündlich "gespeichert". Der Besitzstand einzelner Steine wurde zu Allgemeinwissen. Es war also nicht wichtig, dass die Steine ausgetauscht und transportiert wurden, ausschließlich das gemeinsam geführte Gedächtnisbuch zählte. Jedes Mitglied der Gemeinschaft wusste Bescheid. Ein großer Stein fiel bei der Überfahrt nach Yap von Bord und sank. Obwohl niemand ihn sehen oder angreifen konnte, galt der Stein nach wie vor als Geld, da er am Grund des Meeres vorhanden war.

Dieses Beispiel ist bedeutend, weil es eine natürlich entstandene Nutzung eines gemeinsamen Kontobuches demonstriert. Das Wissen über den Eigentumsstand wurde unter den dort Lebenden ausschließlich mündlich weitergegeben, ohne einen einzigen Stein zu bewegen. Alle waren sich einig, wem welcher Stein gehört und jede einzelne Person konnte dies kontrollieren. Ein Konsens wurde gefunden. Genauso können Sie sich die Funktion der Bitcoin-Blockchain vorstellen. Es ist ein öffentliches Kontobuch aller Transaktionen, die gleichzeitig und synchron auf tausenden Computern (Knoten/Nodes) weltweit gespeichert sind. [^4]

Eine weitere Ähnlichkeit zu Bitcoin ist die Schaffung der Rai Steine, die arbeitsintensiv war und eine Form eines Arbeitsnachweises (Proof-of-Work) darstellt. Die Steine wurden mit der Hand aus dem Fels geschlagen, wogen bis zu 5 Tonnen und wurden mit Kanus 400 km über das Meer auf die Insel Yap gebracht. Als es durch neue Technologien und Werkzeuge einfacher wurde, die Steine herzustellen, verloren sie ihre Bedeutung als Geld, weil sie kein verlässlicher Indikator für investierte Energie mehr waren.

Das Rai Steingeld wird von zeitgenössischen Ökonom*innen als primitive Form des Geldes gesehen. Es dient oft als Beispiel um die These zu veranschaulichen, dass der Wert mancher Geldarten ausschließlich auf gemeinsamem Glauben an dessen Wert fusst.[^5] Das heutige Geld wird ebenfalls durch nichts gedeckt. Es wird lediglich durch staatliche Verordnung etabliert und zum gesetzlichen Zahlungsmittel erklärt. Wir müssen es als Geld verwenden und aufgrund der täglichen Nutzung erachten wir es als wertvoll.


## Wie Geld entsteht

>"Man muss der Zentralbank vertrauen, dass sie die Währung nicht entwertet, aber die Geschichte der Fiat-Währungen ist voll dieser Vertrauensbrüche." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Bitcoin hat mir die Augen geöffnet. Es gibt zwei unterschiedliche Perioden meines Lebens. Die vor Bitcoin und die danach. Ich sehe vieles ganz anders als zuvor. Mein Ziel war, Bitcoin zu verstehen. Zuallererst musste ich unser aktuelles Geld verstehen. Was sind die Unterschiede zwischen dem Euro, dem US-Dollar oder Bitcoin? Was ist Inflation? Welche Rolle spielen die Nationalbanken und so weiter. Wieso lernen wir nichts darüber in der Schule oder ist diese Lücke gar Absicht?

In 195 Ländern der Welt werden 180 verschiedene Währungen verwendet. Eine Währung ist Geld, das allgemein genutzt und vom Staat vorgeschrieben wird. Viele Jurisdikationen setzen ihre Währung auch als gesetzliches Zahlungsmittel fest; dies ist Geld, das per Gesetz für die Bezahlung von Schulden verwendet werden kann und als Form der Bezahlung nicht abgelehnt werden darf.

Alle diese 180 Währungen – beispielsweise US-Dollar, Euro, Yen und das Pfund Sterling – fallen unter die Definition von Fiat-Geld. Seit 1971 ist keine dieser Währungen durch Gold oder irgendeinen anderen materiellen Vermögenswert gedeckt. Geld hat seinen Wert, weil wir daran glauben. Geld ist eine Sprache, die es uns ermöglicht im sozialen Kontext einer Sache Wert zuzuschreiben. Das Wort Fiat stammt aus dem Lateinischen und bedeutet "es geschehe". Unser Geld wird durch einen Eintrag in eine Datenbank erzeugt. Es ist eine Ziffer in einem Buchhaltungssystem. Es steht keine geschaffene Produktivität oder Wert dahinter. 

Who is in charge of the creation of money? It’s a mix of governments and central banks, together with commercial banks. It’s a centralized, hierarchical system with gatekeepers. There is no agreement on a supply limit or emission rate.

Fiat is "money by decree"; it's coercively managed through the state's implicit threat of violence. Value is being maintained by the creation of an endless tax liability that you can only satisfy with fiat money and by state-administered security markets, as well as legal tender laws and tax policy.

* Money is created by central banks in the form of paper money and coins. 
* Central banks buy assets and bonds from the open market, money flows into the system. 
* Money is created through government stimulus, through benefits, grants and bail outs. 
* Money is created by commercial banks through loans.

### Money Is Created Through Debt
The last point is one we all know. It is how we take out a loan to buy a house, start a business or buy a car. The process is easy, but only for those who are already privileged. If you cannot put forward some security as collateral, you are a small business owner, you do not have a regular fixed income job, or you are a woman in a country where women are still forbidden to own any property, then you will probably not qualify for credit at your bank. If you do get the loan, the bank edits its digital ledger and adds the credit sum to its account. You then owe them the loan plus the rate of interest. You must now go out and work or sell something in order to be able to pay back the loan plus the interest rate. It's a great deal for the banks. They add nothing, but earn the fees for your loan agreement and the interest on your payback.

On top of that, there is something called fractional-reserve banking. This allows banks to lend out more money than they hold in reserves or as balances in their account at the central bank. The minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the "reserve ratio", is determined by the central bank. This rate varies from country to country. In the Euro area, banks have to hold a minimum of 1% at the time of writing. In March 2020 the FED abolished this minimum reserve requirement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Hong Kong all have no reserve requirements. If each of us were to go to the bank today and request to withdraw our money, the banking system would fall apart. Because the banks have lent out more money than they own, they would be unable to give you back your own money. 

In 2020 global debt rose by an incredible 24 trillion to 281 trillion USD, or 355% of global GDP. [^6]

![Debt-to-GDP ratios](assets/_Debt-to-GDP-ratio-2020.jpg)

### Central Banks as Lenders of Last Resort
Commercial banks can and have called for the help of the central bank as lenders of last resort. In 2008/2009 the banks, who were responsible for the global financial crisis, received their bail-out money. They were rescued because they were "too big to fail". And what did they do with the money? They bought back shares in their own companies. Nothing "trickled down" down into the economy. The gap between rich and poor inevitably became bigger and bigger.

Central banks are called lenders of last resort. The objective is to prevent economic disruption as a result of financial panics, and bank runs spreading from one bank to the next due to a lack of liquidity. Financial actors like banks know that the central banks will have to bail them out, which leads to moral hazard - excessive risk-taking by both bankers and investors.

The creation of artificial money through central banks overshadowed the distortion in the market. Because of the flooding and manipulation of the monetary system with cheap money, there is no rational price finding mechanism anymore. Usually, supply and demand determine the value of goods and commodities but, in a distorted and manipulated market, there is no room for fair price discovery. The global middle class is paying for the financial elites' greed which, in turn, is being fed by a corrupted system of money creation.

Have you, as an individual, ever been bailed out? And if you have, would you do the same thing over and over again, rigging the system knowing that there is a last resort, which will always bail you out? This is exactly what banks, Wall Street, Hedge Funds and their lobbying lawyers do constantly, assisted by central banks all over the world.

"Classically, central banks hold reserves in case of emergencies, set interest rates, and allocate funds to stimulate or slow economies after disruptive events like panics or wars. The more recent role they have assumed is one of securing the entire financial system and influencing the economic trajectory of entire sovereign nations. This is the antithesis of democratic rule. Such a monetary oligarchy operates beyond democratic norms and limits." [^7]

Naomi Prins' book tapped into the psyche of Wall Street, revealing how the very structure of the financial system hinged on traders flocking to the next big bet, regardless of the stakes. In addition, the _same_ people and families kept popping up, cycling through Wall Street and Washington. They influenced the economy beneath them from their loftier heights of status, private money and public office, dismantling laws that stood in their way and finding loopholes through others. Private banks normalized market manipulation. Central banks made it an art form, with no limits." [^8] 

### Money Supply Inflation

Let's take the US Dollar as an example for all fiat currencies. Because of money supply inflation, the more USD are available, the less value a single note has. Imagine a banknote as a commodity like copper. If there is more copper on the market than there is demand, the price of copper is falling; its value is decreasing. The same is true for your banknote. The value of fiat currencies is determined by supply and demand too. If you increase the supply and the demand stays the same, the value of one unit decreases. 

The money supply consists of various types of money that are generally classified as Ms, such as M0 (base money), M1, M2 and M3. The definitions might vary slightly in different countries. 

The monetary base (M0) is the total amount of a currency in physical paper and coin that is either in circulation in the hands of the public or in the form of commercial bank deposits held in the central bank's reserves. [^9] 

As long as you hold cash, it is an asset like bitcoin, a property that you own. If you take your cash and store it at the bank, you have a claim, but don't own the money anymore. Similar to bitcoin at an exchange.

Any other fiat money supply (M1, M2, M3) is comprised of claims on base money. [^10]

M1 includes M0, demand deposits, traveler’s checks, and other checkable deposits, that are easily convertible to cash.

M2 includes M0, M1, money market securities, mutual funds and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits. M2 is closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation, and as a target for central bank monetary policy.

The amount of M2 currency in circulation in the US was **19.7 trillion USD** in February 2021. [^11] Look at the growth in 2020.

![M2 Money Stock Growth USA, 2021 ](assets/_M2-money-stock-US-2021.png)

"We accept this as normal because we assume it will never end. The fractional reserve banking system has functioned around the world for hundreds of years (first gold-backed, and then totally fiat-based), albeit with occasional inflationary events along the way to partially reset things.

Each individual unit of fiat currency has degraded about 99% in value or more over a multi-decade timeline. This means that investors either need to earn a rate of interest that exceeds the real inflation rate (which is not currently happening), or they need to buy investments instead, which inflates the value of stocks and real estate compared to their cash flows and pushes up the prices of scarce objects like fine art." [^12]

Adding to money supply inflation is the fact that the population in the US and other western nations is not growing at the same rate as the money supply. "US population used to grow at maybe 1.5% per year, and now grows closer to 0.5% per year. That's pretty important. Meanwhile, broad money supply is up 25% year over year, and is on track to be up 75%+ over a rolling 5-year period in the future." [^13]

Strictly speaking, inflation occurs when the money supply outstrips nominal GDP growth, which consists of population and productivity growth. The Consumer Price Index of the USA shows that the prices for goods went up since the value of money has declined.

### Ponzi Scheme

> Ponzi scheme: "A form of fraud in which belief in the success of a fictive enterprise is fostered by payment of quick returns to first investors from money invested by others." - **Oxford English Dictionary**

Bitcoin enemies call it a Ponzi scheme. I say, they either do not understand Bitcoin or what the real Ponzi system is, or they have a vested interest in Bitcoin not succeeding. Charles Ponzi was arrested in the US in 1920 for taking $20 million dollars from tens of thousands of victims. His promise was to double their money within three months. In return for cash, investors received promissory notes that guaranteed the original investment plus 50 percent interest. These notes bore Ponzi's ink-stamped signature. Many referred to them as "Ponzi notes".

> "My business was simple. It was the old game of robbing Peter to pay Paul. You would give me one hundred dollars and I would give you a note to pay you one-hundred-and-fifty dollars in three months…My notes became more valuable than American money…Then came trouble. The whole thing was broken." - **Charles Ponzi**

If you want to know more, [listen to my podcast episode about the life and story of Italian-born Charles Ponzi](https://anita.link/ponzi). You can find it at https://anita.link/ponzi.

**Characteristics of a Ponzi Scheme**

* A Ponzi scheme has a centralized actor, leader or organization that collects investments and runs off in the end. 
* Ponzi schemes are not auditable or transparent. Nobody except the creator knows what happens to the funds. 
* A Ponzi scheme issues money until it breaks - there is no supply limit. 
* Difficulty in repaying investors: the more money that flows into the scheme, the more money has to be paid back, and the more difficult it gets for the creator to stop the machine. 
* The system has to break one day, there is no way out.
* The scammers earn money for lending out funds with no real contribution to the economic performance of a country.
* Greed is driving the Ponzi scheme. Retail investors who get in early, earn interest and tell others, who also want to get rich quick.

Let's compare these characteristics to today's system of money creation.

**Characteristics of Fiat Money Creation**

* Centralized actors like governments, central banks and commercial banks create money.
* The monetary system is not auditable or transparent.
* There is no money supply limit.
* Difficulty in repaying investors: due to the fractional-reserve banking system, if only 20% of a banks customers where to request a payout at the same time the bank gets into trouble and will say "no" to your withdrawal. This happens regularly around the world and happened to some US banks in early 2020 during the pandemic shutdown.
* The system has to break one day, there is no way out.
* Banks earn money for lending out funds with no real contribution to the economic performance of a country.
* Greed is driving the fiat system. Financial elites receive cheap loans because they own securities to buy more securities and grow their wealth and power.

### The Real Ponzi Scheme

* The only similarity between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme is the network effect of greed. But unlike a Ponzi, you can hold the keys to your bitcoin yourself. There is no bank or centralized actor controlling your bitcoin.

* Bitcoin has a limited supply. Only 21 million will ever be created. Bitcoin is finite, fiat currency is infinite. There can be no money supply based inflation in Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin's issuance is predetermined by an algorithm that all actors in Bitcoin have agreed upon and secure via operating nodes. It can not be altered without the consent of the global Bitcoin community. Since the 21 million bitcoin limit is one of the most important features of Bitcoin, an agreement for changing it will be very hard or even impossible to achieve.

* Central bankers are determining the financial fate of all countries around the world. They are not elected, but they act as governments trying to control the entire financial market. 

* The Cantillon effect was described by Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon around 1730. He suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money created by the banks has a localised effect on inflation, rewarding the bankers and close actors by artificially creating money, benefiting those closest to the origin of money. 

> "The Fed's crisis and post-crisis monetary policies, adopted by other major central banks, was supposed to "trickle down" to the masses. That didn't happen. The global elites knew this then, and they are more aware of it now. In January 2017, the World Economic Forum admitted that rising inequality threatens the world economy. These colluders provoke inequality because it benefits them and the preservation of their global power hierarchies to the detriment of everything and everyone else." - **Nomi Prins** [^15]


### The End of This Kind of Growth

Wealth inequality has been rising in the last few centuries along with the commodification and monetization of natural resources. Nothing is left to be consumed. We are living through a fight for resources, for equal opportunities against the establishment and elites enriching themselves through corruption and financial advantages.

"Another by-product of the financial crisis and central bank collusion was the rise in economic anxiety that spawned a swing towards nationalism, from Brazil to Great Britain to the United States. The shock of Brexit in the United Kingdom reverberated around the world as voters turned away from the incumbent leadership and its failed economic policies. In the United States, the election victory of Donald Trump, the billionaire 'antiestablishment' president, was another manifestation of this trend. These landmark votes were not caused by central banking policy directly but were the effects." [^16]

The growing divide between rich and poor is based on our current monetary system, which is the real Ponzi scheme. Central bankers are not democratically elected, yet they decide the financial fate of the world. Bankers and their friends are profiting from this system. It is time for an alternative: a decentralized, open, neutral, transparent, immutable, non-inflatable and collaborative form of money for the people: Bitcoin.

### Today's Petrodollar System

Now that we have discussed how money is created, let's dive into the world of currency wars and how this system of national currencies is exclusive and has, historically, been dominated by different empires.

The history of currency wars is long. "Over the past century the world went from a gold standard system, to the Bretton Woods system, to the Petrodollar system. Each system mostly unraveled from within rather than being brought down externally, and each time one system transitioned to another, a significant and widespread currency devaluation occurred."[^17] 

The British monetary hegemony lasted from 1871 to World War I. Back then a nation's currency was pegged to gold. After the interwar period, when monetary power began to decentralize, the United States emerged as the central money powerhouse after the allied victory in the Second World War. The Bretton Woods system, founded in 1944, was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order, intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. It set a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The United States, which controlled two-thirds of the world's gold, insisted that the Bretton Woods system rests on both gold and the US dollar. Soviet representatives attended the conference but later declined to ratify the final agreements, insisting that the institutions they had created were "branches of Wall Street". This can be interpreted as the starting point of the Cold War.

On 15 August 1971, the United States, lead by President Richard Nixon, unilaterally terminated the convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency. At the same time, many fixed currencies (such as the pound sterling) also became free-floating.

Today's monetary system is built on the Petrodollar. Lyn Alden describes this in her article "The Structure of the Global Monetary System":

"Beginning in 1971 after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, currencies around the world all became fiat currencies, and the global monetary system became less ordered. This was the first time in human history that this happened, where all currencies in the world at the same time were rendered into unbacked paper.

Fiat currency is a monetary system whereby there is nothing of value in the currency itself; it’s just paper, cheap metal coins, or digital bits of information. It has value because the government declares it to have value and that it is legal tender to pay all things including taxes.

A country can enforce the usage of a fiat currency as a medium of exchange and unit of account within their country by making all taxes payable only in that currency, or by enacting other laws to add friction to, or in some cases outright ban, other mediums of exchange and units of account. If their currency has a big enough problem, though, as is the case for many emerging markets, a black market will develop for other mediums of exchange, such as foreign currency or hard assets.

A fiat currency can face particular problems when trying to be used outside of its home country. Why should businesses and governments in other countries accept pieces of paper, which can be printed endlessly by a foreign government and have no firm backing, as a form of payment for their valuable goods and services? Without a real backing, what is it worth? Why would you sell oil to foreigners for paper?

In the early 1970’s, there were a variety of geopolitical conflicts including the Yom Kippur War and the OPEC oil embargo. In 1974, however, the United States and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement, and from there, the world was set on the petrodollar system; a clever way to make a global fiat currency system work decently enough....With the petrodollar system, Saudi Arabia (and other countries in OPEC) sell their oil exclusively in dollars in exchange for US protection and cooperation. Even if France wants to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, for example, they do so in dollars....In return, the United States uses its unrivaled blue-water navy to protect global shipping lanes, and preserve the geopolitical status quo with military action or the threat thereof as needed....Some of us, particularly near the top of the income ladder, directly or indirectly benefit from this system. Americans who work around finance, government, healthcare, and technology get many of the benefits of living in the hegemonic power, without the drawbacks. On the other hand, Americans who make physical products tend not to benefit, because they lost their jobs or had their incomes suppressed, and thus haven’t benefited from the gains. And outside of the United States, exporting countries benefit from the system, while countries that don’t like how the global monetary system is structured don’t have much recourse to do anything about it, unless they get big enough like Russia and China."[^18]

We have been in currency wars for many decades. Which currency is stronger? Which country can gain more benefits from manipulating its currency? The Euro, the US Dollar, the Chinese Yuan? Or even Facebook's Diem? Corporation money is the new, strong player on the market. To retain their powers central banks started to work on their own digital currencies (CBDCs).

![New forms of money emerge](assets/_new-forms-money.png) [^19]

Bitcoin is our alternative to this system. Protecting our privacy in this digital age, voting against the abuse of monopolistic power in the current system, and giving people living in authoritarian states with corrupt rulers the same opportunities to participate in the economic system. Bitcoin is a defence strategy, a tool with which we can preserve the human right to transactional freedom and privacy.
