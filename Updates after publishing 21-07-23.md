136-satoshi-nakamoto change in text:

Hal Finney, an American cryptography and computer expert, had long been involved in the concept of digital money. However, none of the previous solutions were technically or conceptually mature enough to be used widely. The news from Satoshi Nakamoto sounded so interesting that Hal Finney started communicating with Nakamoto. On January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first public Bitcoin block, the so-called "Genesis Block". Since then, on January 3, Bitcoin's birthday has been celebrated. 

On January 8, 2009, Nakamoto released the first version of the Bitcoin software. 

Hal Finney was the first after Nakamoto to install the software on his computer, he famously tweeted "Running Bitcoin" on January 11, 2009 and received a transaction. Hal Finney sadly died of a nerve disease sometime later. Did he know who was hiding behind the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto?

Some hardware wallets (none of the above) use Bluetooth as a connection method. I advise against this because Bluetooth technology is considered relatively unsafe. It is better to connect the hardware wallet with the supplied USB cable.
